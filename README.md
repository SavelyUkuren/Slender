# Tried to make a clone Slender: The eight pages

Guys, don't use this framework lika game engine. It's just awful. If you want to create a game with graphics and setting similar
to this game or any other game (open world, exploration and so on) then **DON'T EVEN TRY**, never,
it's absolutely not suitable for that. It's better to use Unreal Engine, Godot or Unity.
The framework itself is good, but for casual games with simple graphics like (Subway Surfers, Helix Jump and maybe Minecraft).
Just wasted a lot of time and nerves on it.
